### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a DevOps Engineer who is always energetic and eager to learn new skills, take a creative approach to problem solving, always seeking to achieve a high standard in whatever task I'm assigned. I have experience implementing cloud services; graduating top-class especially in the K8s realm, i.e; Used Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment, scaling and management of Docker Containers and on a more professional setting worked extensively on the Openshift Container Platform.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Openshift.     
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GCP.    
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about Docker, Kubernetes, and Openshift.
